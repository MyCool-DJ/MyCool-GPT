Thank you as much as a 30 year old DJ who is the last of the Human jukebox DJ's era. I have always wanted something like this, but didnâ€™t know where to start. Now I have this, also I learned Piano as a teen and hope that I will bring that into my deejaying, I really like synths and want to make that summer sound, tropical, what makes a song tropical, warm, happy, dancey etc.
Yeah cool
Any nightclubs looking for a DJ?
I on @1230 (after a band)
